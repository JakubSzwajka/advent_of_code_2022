# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for advent of code 2022. Decided to try rust since I've never used it. Day 1 is basically my rust hello world. Keep that in mind when comparing solutions across all days.

- days from 1 to 10 are single files. Solutions between part I and II can be found in commits.
- day 7 solution is in Python. I was a bit stuck with implementing tree in rust and wanted to move forward.
- On day 11 I was stuck on performance. I new my solution wasn't optimal enought so I started looking on others solutions. Then found [Romamik's advent of code repo](https://github.com/romamik/aoc2022) which inspired me to change a lot.

  - Add tests,
  - Change structure,
  - Split into modules,
  - etc.

  Since day 11, I tried to build the code the way I can keep both parts doable at the same time in tests. It came out to be a nice code architecture exercise!

## ‚≠ê days

- Day 11. Monkey business. Optimalization problem with [Least Common Multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
- Day 12. [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
